Codon table used:1
Results:
26 genes have been modified. These genes have  34 mRNA, and we fixed the ORF of 28 of them.
11 model1: Prediction contains the orignal prediction but is longer.
2 model2: Longer prediction found non-overlapping the original one.
4 model3: Longer prediction found overlapping the original one but doesn't contain it(frame different).
0 model4: The prediction is shorter due to the presence of stop codon in the original CDS.
11 model5: The prediction is shorter but the original CDS sequence has not premature stop codonThe original CDS does not start by a start codon, it is probably incomplete or fragmented (begining or finishing by NNNN or XXXX). The prediction is probably shorter because it is forced to use a start codon.
0 model6: The prediction is the same size (AA size) but the original CDS has premature stop codons while the prediction not. This is a particular case where a +1 or +2 bp shift at the beginning of the sequencethat gives frame shifts in the original sequence but they are removed for the new prediction.

/!\Remind:
 L and M are AA are possible start codons for standard codon table.
Particular case: If we have a triplet as WTG, AYG, RTG, RTR or ATK it will be seen as a possible Methionine codon start (it's a X aa)
